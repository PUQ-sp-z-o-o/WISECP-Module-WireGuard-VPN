In the opened tab, you have a view of the online status of the service. The available online information includes:

- Connection status to the API
- Information about the VPN account on the PUQVPNCP server
- Diagnostic information about the account (online status, firewall rule counters, and so on).

Also, below are fields with the client's personal data, such as Username, Password, Server, and Dedicated IP.  
  
You can also individually override package options for the client by checking the 'Overwrite package settings' box.

>After modifying the configuration options, check the '**Send changes to server**' box to save the data to the PUQVPNCP server.
